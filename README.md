### Rule #1: Never Risk More Than 2% Per Trade
If your account balance is $1,000, your maximum stake should be $20.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Run multiple Deriv bots with different strategies.

Always backtest your Deriv bot on historical data and run it on a demo account before going live.

### Rule #6: Monitor Regularly
Check your Deriv bot's performance daily. Be ready to pause if something looks wrong.

Let your Deriv bot follow its programmed logic. Don't manually intervene based on fear or greed.

## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer

**Trading carries substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors.** Automated trading systems like Deriv bots can amplify both gains and losses. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

Tuplemint provides tools for building and deploying trading strategies, but does not guarantee profits. You are solely responsible for your trading decisions and outcomes. Never invest money you cannot afford to lose.

**Key Risks:**
- **Market Risk:** Prices can move against your position
- **Leverage Risk:** Deriv offers leverage, which magnifies losses
- **Technical Risk:** Software bugs or connectivity issues
- **Strategy Risk:** No strategy works in all market conditions
- **Execution Risk:** Slippage and delayed fills

**Please:**
- Start with a demo account
- Only trade with money you can afford to lose
- Use proper risk management
- Diversify your strategies
- Keep emotions out of trading decisions
- Seek professional financial advice if needed
